# Prodigy-Infotech-Projects:
I am incredibly grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for providing me with the opportunity to work on diverse and challenging projects. This experience has been immensely valuable in honing my data science and machine learning skills. Here is a brief overview of the projects I worked on:

1. Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction
Developed and deployed a robust Linear Regression Model to predict house prices. The model utilized key features such as living area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, achieving an R-squared score of 0.63 . This project involved extensive data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), and was visualized through detailed scatter plots to showcase the alignment between predicted and actual values.

2. SVM Classifier for Cats vs Dogs
Built an SVM Classifier to distinguish between cats and dogs, achieving an impressive accuracy of 0.92. The project included organizing and preprocessing large datasets, validating images, and extensive model training and evaluation. The trained model was saved for future use, ensuring its applicability in various real-world scenarios.

3. CNN for Hand Gesture Recognition
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for hand gesture recognition. The model, leveraging advanced image preprocessing and augmentation techniques, achieved significant training accuracy improvements. Despite challenges with validation accuracy suggesting potential overfitting, this project highlighted critical areas for enhancement, including data augmentation and model architecture optimization.

4. CNN for Food Image Classification and Calorie Estimation
Implemented a CNN for food image classification and calorie estimation. This project involved preprocessing and organizing large datasets, building and training a robust CNN model, and mapping food items to their respective calorie content. Despite challenges with model generalization, the training accuracy showed steady improvement. Future steps include enhancing data augmentation and model architecture to improve performance on unseen data.

5. K-means Clustering for Customer Segmentation
Utilized K-means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The project involved preprocessing customer data, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method, and visualizing the customer segments. The clustering results revealed distinct customer groups, enabling more targeted marketing strategies and business insights.
